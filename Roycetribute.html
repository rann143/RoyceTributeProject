      <p id="bio1-p">Trained by his father, Royce Gracie began competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments since he was 8 years old. He grew up to become one of Jiu-Jitsu's most prominent and influential figures. Using techniques from this relatively new martial art, he became a three-time UFC champion. Throughout his life, he has helped grow awareness of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA. In 2003, he became the first fighter to be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.</p>
